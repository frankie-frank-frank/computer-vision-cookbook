TENSOR DIMENSIONALITY AND SHAPE:

- 0D tensors --> 0 with shape of 0
- 1D tensors --> [1,2,4] with shape of (3, )
- 2D tensors -->
    [
        1 1 1
        2 3 4
    ] with shape of (2, 3)
* A 3D tensor has (Ra, Rb, Rc) shape. Assume the 2D tensor above is stacked with another, the dimension will be (2, 2, 3)



PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION:
- Uniform distribution - all items have equal probability of being picked
- Normal distribution - items close to the middle have closer chance of being picked


SELECTING VALUES FROM A TENSOR:
given an a*b*...n shaped tensor, selecting from it results in a tensor with at least one dimension lower.


3-D ARRAY MULTIPLICATION:
C = A * B
A : b, i, j --> WHERE b is the batch size
B : b, j, k
C: b, i, k
